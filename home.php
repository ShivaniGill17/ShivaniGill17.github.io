            <P>We know the very best thing for a child is to be part of a loving family—it’s where they thrive. That’s why everything we do is designed to accomplish just that.
            <br>
Our goal is a loving family and the end of institutionalized care for every child. We believe that, together, we can change the way we care for children and help to get them into stable, loving, nurturing environments. We believe in them, in you and in Miracles. We believe in a world that listens closely to children and gives them a voice.
<br>
VISION is an INDIAN based national non-profit that brings life-changing care to orphaned and vulnerable children. And that’s just the beginning. These children deserve the very best.  A way out of their past of abandonment and a way forward into their bright future. We believe in partnerships, and with generous gifts from people like you, we can make their dream of living with a family a reality.
</P>

                  <p>The performing arts allow an avenue to develop cognitive abilities that complement children in other disciplines. Our Country is a land of varied cultures and traditions. The diversity of India culture is not hidden from the rest of the world. The massive celebration of festivals of India make it “The land of celebrations “. </p>
                  <p>UTSAV is an important festival for “VISION” because the children of vision show their talent in front of our guest Donors,  Sponsors,  and other important Persons. In UTSAV we try to include those dance forms which represent our Indian culture and tradition and also display the creative art that was learnt by the children throughout the year in vocational programs. Various workshop organised by volunteers to show the creativity of VISION children.</p>
