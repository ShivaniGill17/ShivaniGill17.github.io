           <p>Almost 20+ closed circuit tv camera systems operate night and day in all public spaces across our compound to assist in keeping our children safe.</p>
           
           <h4>Safety Awareness</h4>
           <p>We conduct mock drill programs to aware the children from different situations.</p>
           
           <h4>Education</h4>
           <p>We never compromise in child’s education and we make sure that every child in our VISION gets the best education so that no one feels left out. To achieve this, we have the experienced teachers, caretakers and Interns. </p>
           
           <h4>Experience</h4>
           <p>With over 25+ years of collective experience in child care, we are always alert for signs of abuse. Our team constantly monitors interactions between staff, volunteers, visitors and children for signs of abuse.</p>
           
           <h4>No Tolerance Policy</h4>
           <p>We believe there is no room for error when it comes to the protection of children. Our no tolerance policy does not allow any room for those who would seek to hurt our children.</p>
