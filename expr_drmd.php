            <p class="expr_info">We organize  vocational trainings in  every three months for one month  in which we provide multiple training to children. These trainings are given by interns to different age groups. There are number  of training programs offered in the vocational training. Out of every single experience on this, the one thing we love the most is witnessing the strong sense of community through these programs. It helps to live as a one body.Besides studies, these type of programs help the children to be more interactive, skilfull and develop their interests in different fields. From these, children are able to gain some experience about something so that they can perform better in their lives. Whenever there is any occassion or function,children presents their work to the guests and people around them. This little step encourages them and no one feels like a complete stranger, rather a fellow member.It is inspiring to see how our little step can really change the lives of them. Everyday in VISION is full of laughter. This organization is about more than just feeding children and providing them with an education, but about changing their lives, including your own, giving them a solid chance in life and this is exactly we are trying to be done. </p>
