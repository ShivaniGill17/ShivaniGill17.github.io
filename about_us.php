          <h3>"God is a father to the fatherless"</h3>
          
          <p class="abt-descrptn">We know the very best thing for a child is to be part of a loving family—it’s where they thrive. That’s why everything we do is designed to accomplish just that.
Our goal is a loving family and the end of institutionalized care for every child. We believe that, together, we can change the way we care for children and help to get them into stable, loving, nurturing environments. We believe in them, in you and in Miracles. We believe in a world that listens closely to children and gives them a voice.
VISION is an INDIAN based national non-profit that brings life-changing care to orphaned and vulnerable children. And that’s just the beginning…
</p>
          
          <p class="abt_sub_title">How we Began?</p>
          <p class="abt_sub_content"><b>VISION</b> began on Children’s day in 1990, when Mr. Brijesh Singh was shocked by the conditions in which the children lived, but captivated by their strength, beauty and incredible, untapped potential.
          Brijesh’s desire to help children was partly a result from his own childhood experience. With a heart for children surviving in difficult circumstances, Brijesh has deep compassion for children who have been abandoned or suffer the pain of homelessness spurred him to action.

                    <p class="dff_title_content">The vision model is all about finding a loving family for every orphaned child. That is our ultimate goal. We explore every avenue to reunite kids with their kin and allocate resources to more effectively facilitate family-based care options, including adoption. While children are in transition to a family, we guarantee that they receive a quality education, a safe and loving environment and personalized care so they are healthy and known.</p>

                         <p class="dff_title_content">As the saying goes, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” Instead of “giving fish” to help orphaned children short term, we teach leaders how to prevent children from entering the system, reunify children with their families, and strengthen community and family involvement with any child waiting for a permanent home. This is a lifetime solution. And it’s a win-win for all..</p>

                        <p class="dff_title_content">Education liberates. Each child is given a quality education through secondary school, with the opportunity for college scholarships or vocational training after that. In fact, we’re sending hundreds of kids to college, and they’re studying things like engineering, social work, nursing, accounting, and natural sciences! Our goal is to have each child become a healthy, happy, self-sustaining person—and break the cycle of poverty.</p>
